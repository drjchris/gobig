# GoBig project

A repository for all the scripts utilised in the "go big" project.

The entire thing should run in one go, all that is needed is the dataset placed in a folder called `datasets`. The folder should be in the root directory.

Then, once you `cd` to the root folder you just do ...

```
python3 _run_gobig.py
```
